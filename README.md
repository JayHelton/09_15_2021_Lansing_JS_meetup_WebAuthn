### WebAuthn Demo for Lansing Codes JS Meetup 09/15/2021

This repo holds the example code used for the WebAuthn and the Future of Web Security talk given by myself to the Lansing Codes JS meetup group.

This repo should be used as an example of how to achieve passwordless or usernameless flows using SimpleWebAuthn library.

This example _does not_ follow best practices for signing tokens and sessions. Do not use this as a full end to end example of an authorization flow.

```git clone https://github.com/JayHelton/09_15_2021_Lansing_JS_meetup_WebAuthn.git```
